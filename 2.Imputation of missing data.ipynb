    "In Time-Series data, we use something called rolling mean or moving average or window mean which is taking mean of values pertaining to a predefined window for e.g., a 7-day window or a 1-month window. So, we can utilize this moving average to fill in any missing gaps in our time-series data.\n",

    "Interpolations are quite popular: in brief, use the value present before and after the missing point to calculate the missing datum For eg, Linear interpolations work by calculating a straight line between the two points, averaging them, and getting the missing datum.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many types of interpolations available like Linear, Spline, Stineman. Their implementations are given in almost all major modules like pythonâ€™s pandas interpolate() function and R imputeTime-Series package."
