    "* Trend: Time-series data shows a trend when its value variably changes with time, an increasing value shows a positive trend and decreasing, a negative trend. eg., you can see a positive increasing trend.\n",
    "* Seasonality: Seasonality refers to a property of time-series that displays periodical patterns repeating at a constant frequency. In the example above, we can observe a seasonal component with the frequency being 12 months, which broadly means that the periodical pattern repeats every twelve months.\n",
    "* Remainder: After extracting Trend and Seasonality from the data, the remaining is what we call remainder (error) or Residual. This actually helps in anomaly detection in time-series.\n",
    "* Cycle: Time-series data is termed cyclical when there are trends with no set repetitions or seasonality.\n",
    "* Stationarity: Time-series data is stationary when its statistical features do not change over time i.e. a constant mean and standard deviation. The covariance is independent of time.\n"
