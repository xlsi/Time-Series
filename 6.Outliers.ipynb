    "* Single Exponential Smoothing, also called Simple Exponential Smoothing, is a time series forecasting method for univariate data without a trend or seasonality.\n",
    "* Double Exponential Smoothing is an extension to Exponential Smoothing that explicitly adds support for trends in the univariate time series. Double Exponential Smoothing with an additive trend is classically referred to as Holtâ€™s linear trend model, named after the developer of the method, Charles Holt.\n",
