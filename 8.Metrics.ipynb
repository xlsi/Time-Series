    "A very often used model in forecasting is the Mean Squared Error. This metric measures the error at each point in time and takes the square of it. The average of those squared errors is called the Mean Squared Error. An often-used alternative is the Root Mean Squared Error: the square root of the Mean Squared Error.  \n",
    "Another frequently used metric is the Mean Absolute Error: rather than taking the square of each error, it takes the absolute value here. The Mean Absolute Percent Error is a variation on this where the Absolute Error at each point in time is expressed as a percentage of the actual value. This yields a metric that is a percentage, which is very easy to interpret."
